My hometowns are Sinait and San Esteban, Ilocos Sur, but I grew up in Manila; my family decided to stay here for the COVID-19 lockdown due to safety reasons, and we haven't been back in Manila ever since March of 2020. I really enjoy going to beaches and doing water activities like surfing and diving. With this, I spend a lot of my time in beaches, and what I've long noticed was that there was an alarming number of trash by the shore — even the lesser known beaches. \\n\\n          </p> <div class=\\\"welcome-one__our-mission-and-story\\\"><div class=\\\"welcome-one__mission-and-story-single\\\"><h3><i class=\\\"fas fa-arrow-circle-right\\\"></i>How it started</h3> <p class=\\\"welcome-one__our-mission-and-story-text\\\">\\n                I founded it on my birthday as a mere cleanup idea that turned into an organization after realizing that cleanups aren’t enough and that we have to be more sustainable. Though for our first project, we did a cleanup on my favorite beach here and we donated three trash bins for the beach and held a post-cleanup talk about sustainability with the barangay officials. I started posting about my birthday plan on my Instagram, and I'm really thankful for the support I got!\\n              </p></div> <br> <div class=\\\"welcome-one__mission-and-story-single\\\"><h3><i class=\\\"fas fa-arrow-circle-right\\\"></i>At first glance</h3> <p class=\\\"welcome-one__our-mission-and-story-text\\\">\\n                Taken from my statement during the first days of setting up this organization: **&quot;*I haven't had the guts to start something like this up until now, because I believe that there is no better time than now, and that I couldn't go to the beach anymore and still do nothing about the trash that I see.\\n              </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>\")])\n}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","import mod from \"-!../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js??ref--2-0!../node_modules/@nuxt/components/dist/loader.js??ref--0-0!../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./AboutTwo.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js??ref--2-0!../node_modules/@nuxt/components/dist/loader.js??ref--0-0!../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./AboutTwo.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./AboutTwo.vue?vue&type=template&id=2a648957&\"\nimport script from \"./AboutTwo.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./AboutTwo.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  \"17edc7e6\"\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/welcome-one-heart-icon.6a2f3f8.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/welcome-one-img-1.3fe8e43.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/welcome-one-img-2.111bab8.jpg\";"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;;;;;AADA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;AC1BA;;;;;ACAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;AClBA;;;;;;;ACAA;;;;;;;ACAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
